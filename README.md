The repository is organized as follows:

The 'image_files' folder contains the analysis code used to analyzed the data/Monte Carlo.

The 'Root_Results' folder contains ROOT files with the results of the different analysis.

The 'graphs' folder contains the graphs that were considered definitive for the project.

The 'CrossSection_figures' folder contains images for the Cross Section analysis specifically. 

Some of the code (the one used for the initial event selection analysis) is still not displayed here.
